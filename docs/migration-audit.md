# Migration Audit
**Source:** https://www.peter-buck.com (live, rendered via Playwright)
**Audit date:** 2026-07-17
**Scope:** Every page and component classified as Verified / Blocked / Needs Owner Decision
**Evidence base:** See rendered-site-inventory.md for raw data. Every finding here is supported by screenshot, computed style, DOM inspection, or HTTP response.
**Rule:** No fixes proposed. No redesigns. No implementation decisions.

---

## Classification Key

- **Verified** — Content, behaviour, and rendering confirmed. Can be faithfully reproduced.
- **Blocked** — Cannot be confirmed or reproduced without external action (missing content, broken URL, cross-origin restriction, third-party dependency).
- **Needs Owner Decision** — Technically verifiable but contains an ambiguity, conflict, or risk that requires a human decision before migration proceeds.

## 2. Anomaly Register

### A1 — Home page metadata describes Kill Dull Records, not the CCO portfolio
**Severity:** High
**Pages affected:** `/` and `/work` (same content, same meta)
**Evidence:**
- `document.title` = "THE REVISIONS – Kill Dull Records"
- `meta[name="description"]` = "Kill Dull Records is an independent record label dedicated to music that refuses to play it safe. Home of The Revisions. killdull.com"
- `og:title` = "THE REVISIONS – Kill Dull Records"
- `og:url` = "https://www.peter-buck.com" (no trailing slash, differs from canonical)
- Actual page content = CCO portfolio (12 case studies, 12-values counter, AI widget)
**Classification:** Needs Owner Decision
**What is blocked:** Cannot determine the intended identity of the home page (record label or CCO portfolio) from rendered content alone. The page renders as a portfolio; the metadata describes a record label.

---

### A2 — `/work` is a canonical duplicate of `/` in the sitemap at priority 1.0
**Severity:** Medium
**Pages affected:** `/work`
**Evidence:**
- `link[rel="canonical"]` on `/work` = `https://www.peter-buck.com/`
- DOM content on `/work` = identical to `/` (same `.pbfw-counter`, same case study list)
- Sitemap lists `/work` with `priority: 1.0` (highest priority) — but the canonical is `/`
- `/work` is not in the main nav; `/` is listed as "WORK" in nav
**Classification:** Needs Owner Decision
**What is blocked:** Whether `/work` should be kept as an alias, redirected to `/`, or removed.

---

### A3 — `/pitch` returns HTTP 404 but is linked from the live homepage
**Severity:** High
**Pages affected:** `/pitch`
**Evidence:**
- HTTP status: 404 (confirmed by Playwright navigation response)
- Linked from `/` Innovation section: "KILL DULL workshops" → `/pitch`
- Not present in sitemap.xml
- 404 page renders Squarespace default error: "We couldn't find the page you were looking for."
- Screenshot: audit-screens/pitch/desktop-1440.png
**Classification:** Blocked
**What is blocked:** No content to migrate. The link is live in production pointing to a non-existent page. Cannot determine if the page was removed, is being rebuilt, or was never published.

---

### A4 — Two distinct Red Bull pages with overlapping brand name
**Severity:** Medium
**Pages affected:** `/work-1/redbull`, `/work-1/red-bull`
**Evidence:**
- `/work-1/redbull`: "Red Bull — Peter Buck | ECD, $20B Brand, 43% Global Market Share" — 7 Vimeo iframes, 80 images, comprehensive case study
- `/work-1/red-bull`: "Red Bull Silicon Valley OOH – Peter Buck | Binary Code Campaign" — 0 iframes, 1 image, short OOH piece
- Both are in sitemap.xml under different slugs with different lastmod dates
- `/work-1/redbull` is linked from home (`/`) and `/work-1` index
- `/work-1/red-bull` is not linked from home or `/work-1` index (only in sitemap)
**Classification:** Needs Owner Decision
**What is blocked:** Whether `/work-1/red-bull` is a published piece, a draft, or content to be integrated into `/work-1/redbull`. Navigation structure cannot be determined without owner input.

---

### A5 — `/therevisions-1` shares identical metadata with `/therevisions`
**Severity:** Medium
**Pages affected:** `/therevisions-1`
**Evidence:**
- `/therevisions-1` meta description: "The first AI agency band. Ten departments. One member. Zero meetings." — identical to `/therevisions`
- `/therevisions-1` OG title: "Peter Buck — CCO | Brand Strategy & Creative Leadership" — same as all other pages
- `/therevisions-1` actual content: CMO Confessions EP — distinct from `/therevisions` (main album)
- `/therevisions-1` not in main nav (only "THE REVISIONS" appears, linking to `/therevisions`)
**Classification:** Needs Owner Decision
**What is blocked:** Whether `/therevisions-1` is a standalone page, a sub-section of `/therevisions`, or a separate navigation entry. Metadata should be unique per page (owner decision on new meta copy).

---

### A6 — `/instrument` has empty meta description, null OG image, not in navigation
**Severity:** Low–Medium
**Pages affected:** `/instrument`
**Evidence:**
- `getMeta('description')` = `""` (empty string)
- `getMeta('og:image')` = null
- Not present in main nav; not linked from any other page (only discoverable via sitemap)
- Content: 1 track ("The Right Room") + full lyrics — appears to be a teaser/coming-soon page
**Classification:** Needs Owner Decision
**What is blocked:** Whether this page is published intentionally or is a work-in-progress. Whether it should be discoverable. What the meta description should be.

---

### A7 — `/work-1` index has empty meta description, no OG image, not in main nav
**Severity:** Medium
**Pages affected:** `/work-1`
**Evidence:**
- `getMeta('description')` = `""` (empty)
- `getMeta('og:image')` = null
- Not in main nav (nav shows WORK → `/`, not → `/work-1`)
- Sitemap: present with priority 0.75
- Content: "LET'S GO TO WORK." grid of 12 case study thumbnails (images have alt text on this page)
**Classification:** Needs Owner Decision
**What is blocked:** Relationship between `/` (home showing case study list) and `/work-1` (separate work index showing the same cases). Whether `/work-1` replaces, duplicates, or supplements the home page case list.

---

### A8 — 22 audio tracks hosted on Squarespace CDN (static1.squarespace.com)
**Severity:** High (migration risk)
**Pages affected:** `/therevisions` (13 tracks), `/therevisions-1` (8 tracks), `/instrument` (1 track)
**Evidence:**
- All audio uses Squarespace `sqs-block-audio` custom components
- MP3 URLs confirmed via `childLinks` on `.sqs-block-audio` elements, e.g.:
  - `https://static1.squarespace.com/static/671fc066e85fae213d2acc8a/t/6a3ace8e.../1_Ceative+Climax.mp3`
- NOT native `<audio>` elements — invisible to `querySelectorAll('audio')`
- Download link on `/therevisions`: Google Drive folder
- Player component is Squarespace-proprietary (renders as custom block)
**Classification:** Blocked (requires hosting decision)
**What is blocked:** MP3 files will need to be re-hosted when leaving Squarespace. The Squarespace audio player component needs a replacement. Google Drive download link is an external dependency that may or may not transfer. Owner must confirm audio file availability outside Squarespace.

---

### A9 — 30+ Vimeo iframes (cross-origin — internal state not inspectable)
**Severity:** Low (Vimeo embeds migrate by URL)
**Pages affected:** 9 pages (see inventory Section 6)
**Evidence:**
- All confirmed as `player.vimeo.com` iframes via `iframe.src`
- `iframe.title` missing on 26 of 30+ embeds
- Internal Vimeo player state (playback, settings) not accessible cross-origin
**Classification:** Verified (embed src confirmed; titles need addition for accessibility)
**What is not verifiable:** Whether individual Vimeo videos are public/private/password-protected. Cannot confirm playability without clicking play in the rendered browser (not tested).

---

### A10 — AI chat widget ("Ask my AI") — third-party, class prefix `pbfw`
**Severity:** Medium (migration dependency)
**Pages affected:** `/` (home), `/cart`, `/work-1` (footer)
**Evidence:**
- Widget confirmed functional: button click → panel opens → AI responds to queries
- Class prefix `pbfw` — custom implementation, not a standard Squarespace component
- API endpoint not inspectable (cross-origin XHR)
- Widget script source not confirmed (blocked by cross-origin and Squarespace bundling)
**Classification:** Blocked (requires owner input on provider)
**What is blocked:** Cannot determine the third-party provider, API endpoint, or embedding mechanism without owner disclosure. Migration requires knowing the widget script source and whether an API key/account is tied to the Squarespace domain.

---

### A11 — Missing alt text on ~134 of ~163 images across case studies
**Severity:** Medium (accessibility)
**Pages affected:** All case studies except /riester (0 missing) and /work-1 index (0 missing)
**Worst case:** `/work-1/redbull` — 80 images, 80 missing alt
**Evidence:** `imgs.filter(i => !i.alt).length` per page
**Classification:** Verified (missing alt confirmed)
**Note:** These are facts about the current site. Not proposing fixes.

---

### A12 — Hamburger nav element has no ARIA label and is a DIV, not a button
**Severity:** Low (accessibility)
**Pages affected:** All pages at ≤768px viewport
**Evidence:** DOM inspection: `{ tag: 'DIV', label: null }` for hamburger element; no `role="button"`, no `aria-label`
**Classification:** Verified

---

### A13 — `/cart` has no visible commerce content
**Severity:** Unknown
**Pages affected:** `/cart`
**Evidence:** Page loads with site chrome (200 OK). `cartItems: 0`, `hasCheckout: false`. Body text shows only header + AI widget + footer.
**Classification:** Needs Owner Decision
**What is blocked:** Whether the Squarespace commerce/cart feature is intentionally enabled (e.g., for future album sales), was used previously, or is vestigial.

---

### A14 — `book-peter-buck.vercel.app` — external dependency on Vercel-hosted site
**Severity:** Low
**Pages affected:** `/think` (linked as "Humanizing an AI-Driven World"), `/` (footer link)
**Evidence:** Absolute external URL in DOM links
**Classification:** Verified (link present and verified in DOM)
**Note:** This is a separate site — not subject to this migration. Flag for awareness only.

---

### A15 — Sitemap `og:image` for home page uses HTTP not HTTPS
**Severity:** Low
**Pages affected:** `/`
**Evidence:**
- `getMeta('og:image')` = `"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/.../Logo_CA.png?format=1500w"` — HTTP, not HTTPS
**Classification:** Verified (anomaly recorded)

## 4. Risk Summary Before Implementation

### High risk
1. **22 audio tracks** on Squarespace CDN will become inaccessible once the Squarespace subscription is cancelled. No alternative hosting confirmed. (A8)
2. **`/pitch` is broken** (404) and linked live from the homepage. (A3)
3. **Home page metadata** does not match page content — title and description describe the record label, not the CCO portfolio. (A1)

### Medium risk
4. **AI widget** provider and API endpoint unknown — migration requires owner to identify and re-configure. (A10)
5. **Two Red Bull pages** (`/redbull` and `/red-bull`) — unclear navigation relationship and whether both should be preserved. (A4)
6. **`/therevisions-1` and `/instrument`** are not in the main nav — access is only via sitemap or direct URL. Whether these remain accessible post-migration needs a decision. (A5, A6)
7. **~134 images missing alt text** across case studies — current state documented. (A11)

### Low risk (but must be resolved)
8. **`/work` canonical duplicate** in sitemap at priority 1.0 — sitemap should be reconciled. (A2)
9. **`/cart`** — Squarespace commerce route with no visible purpose. (A13)
10. **`/work-1` index** — not in main nav, empty metadata — relationship to home page needs clarification. (A7)
11. **Hamburger is a DIV** with no ARIA — current state documented. (A12)
12. **OG image uses HTTP** not HTTPS on home page. (A15)

## 5. Needs Owner Decision — Full List

| ID | Question | Affects | Status |
|----|----------|---------|--------|
| OD-1 | Is the home page (/) the CCO portfolio or Kill Dull Records? The metadata says record label; the content says portfolio. What should the title, description, and OG be? | `/`, `/work` | Open |
| OD-2 | Should `/work` be redirected to `/` or maintained as a separate URL? | `/work` | Open |
| OD-3 | What is `/pitch`? Is this page being rebuilt, intentionally removed, or should the homepage link be updated? | `/pitch`, `/` | Open |
| OD-4 | Are both `/work-1/redbull` and `/work-1/red-bull` intended to exist as separate pages? Should both appear in navigation? | `/work-1/redbull`, `/work-1/red-bull` | Open |
| OD-5 | Where will the 22 audio MP3 files be hosted after leaving Squarespace? What audio player component replaces the Squarespace audio block? | `/therevisions`, `/therevisions-1`, `/instrument` | **Deferred — v2** (see Section 6) |
| OD-6 | Who provides the AI chat widget ("Ask my AI")? What is the provider, API key, and domain configuration? Is it tied to the Squarespace domain? | `/`, footer | Open |
| OD-7 | Is `/therevisions-1` (CMO Confessions) a sub-section of `/therevisions` or a standalone page? Should it be in the navigation? | `/therevisions-1` | **Deferred — v2** (see Section 6) |
| OD-8 | Is `/instrument` intentionally unlisted? Is it a teaser, a draft, or a live page? Should it be discoverable in navigation or linked from `/therevisions`? | `/instrument` | **Deferred — v2** (see Section 6) |
| OD-9 | What is the purpose of `/work-1`? Is it intended to replace or supplement the case study list on `/`? | `/work-1`, `/` | Open |
| OD-10 | Is Squarespace commerce (`/cart`) being used or planned for use? Should it be preserved? | `/cart` | Open |
| OD-11 | Is the Google Drive album download link on `/therevisions` the intended permanent distribution method, or will audio be self-hosted? | `/therevisions` | **Deferred — v2** (see Section 6) |

---

## 6. Deferred Feature Groups

### DFG-1 — The Revisions / music section

**Owner decision recorded:** These pages are out of scope for PB-001 v1 and will not be implemented in the initial migration. No pages, no placeholders, no audio players, no Google Drive download links.

**Deferred pages:**
- `/therevisions` — main Kill Dull Records / The Revisions page; 13 audio tracks, Squarespace audio block player
- `/therevisions-1` — CMO Confessions EP; 8 audio tracks, Squarespace audio block player
- `/instrument` — single track teaser ("The Right Room"); 1 audio track, full lyrics

**What is preserved for future implementation:**
- All source content (track listings, descriptions, lyrics) is audited and recorded in `docs/rendered-site-inventory.md`
- All 22 MP3 file URLs on `static1.squarespace.com` are recorded in the site inventory
- Google Drive album download link URL is recorded in the site inventory
- Audit screenshots exist in `audit-screens/therevisions/`, `audit-screens/therevisions-1/`, `audit-screens/instrument/`

**What v2 will need to resolve (previously OD-5, OD-7, OD-8, OD-11):**
- Hosting destination for 22 MP3 files (Squarespace CDN will be inaccessible post-migration)
- Replacement for the Squarespace proprietary audio block player component
- Navigation relationship between `/therevisions` and `/therevisions-1`
- Whether `/instrument` should be discoverable or remain unlisted
- Whether Google Drive remains the album download mechanism or audio is self-hosted

**v1 nav impact:** THE REVISIONS nav link is present in the live site header. In v1 it will either link to a future URL (deferred) or be omitted from the nav. This is a decision for Checkpoint 3 scoping.

---

## 7. Checkpoint Implementation Log

### Checkpoint 3 — `/work-1/[slug]` case-study template + Red Bull

**Status:** Complete — verified, awaiting owner approval before proceeding to remaining case studies.

**Files changed:**
- `content/case-studies/types.ts` — CaseStudy, StoryRow union, MediaSlot types
- `content/case-studies/redbull.ts` — Red Bull content: 40 CDN images, 7 Vimeo IDs, all text, pagination
- `content/case-studies/index.ts` — registry with `getCaseStudy` / `getAllSlugs`
- `app/work-1/[slug]/page.tsx` — dynamic App Router template; handles all StoryRow variants; generates static params; server-side metadata
- `components/Header.tsx` — removed THE REVISIONS nav link (DFG-1 deferred)

**Build status:** typecheck ✓ — lint ✓ — build ✓ (SSG: `/work-1/redbull` prerendered)

**Screenshots:** `implementation-screens/checkpoint-3/redbull-{1440,768,390}.png`

#### Fidelity differences vs audit-screens/work-1--redbull/

| Viewport | Difference | Likely cause |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| All | Page slightly shorter than live (~10–20%) | Squarespace Fluid Engine renders images at larger natural sizes; our template uses audited `w`/`h` props but some images default to 960×540 placeholder dimensions. No content is missing. |
| All | Below-fold story content invisible in full-page screenshot | Expected — IntersectionObserver fires only for elements in initial viewport; scroll-reveal hides off-screen elements at opacity 0. Live behavior identical when scrolling. |
| 1440 | Small yellow dot mid-right in audit; absent in implementation | Squarespace built-in UI element (likely scroll-to-top or page progress indicator). Not part of content. Not implementing. |
| All | Vimeo iframes render as blank/error boxes | Vimeo enforces domain allowlist; embeds return 403 on localhost. Will resolve on the production domain. Not a code issue. |

---

#### Anomalies logged — Needs Owner Decision

**CP3-OD-1 — Red Bull pagination: no Previous link (faithful)**
The live `/work-1/redbull` page shows only "Next → EōS Fitness" with no Previous link. Red Bull is the first entry in the case study series. Faithfully reproduced: `redbull.ts` has no `prev` key. No fix applied.

**CP3-OD-2 — Next link target not yet built**
`next: { slug: "eos-fitness", label: "EōS Fitness" }` links to `/work-1/eos-fitness`. That route does not exist yet in the migration (only `redbull` has been built). Clicking Next on the Red Bull page currently returns 404. This will resolve automatically when `eos-fitness` is built in a subsequent checkpoint. No action needed unless the owner wants a temporary fallback.

**CP3-OD-3 — Two Red Bull pages (pre-existing anomaly, noted for Checkpoint 3)**
The live site has both `/work-1/redbull` (built in this checkpoint) and `/work-1/red-bull` (row 11 in page status table, OD-4, still Open). The migration implements `/work-1/redbull` only. `/work-1/red-bull` awaits owner decision.
